This page is intended to give a brief overview of a few key Scala concepts for Chisel users.

For people completely new to Scala, we recommend working through an online tutorial like [this one](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scala/index.htm) or [this one](http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/); or better yet, taking the [Functional Programming in Scala Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1)

### Classes

Classes are declared in Scala via the `class` keyword. They only have 1 constructor which is the body of the class. Arguments can also be passed to the constructor as shown in the following example:

```scala
// value is a private field of the class while message is public (making it a val makes it public)
class Foo(value: Int, val message: String) {
  def func() = println("My value is " + value + " and my message is \"" + message + "\"")
}
```

Classes are instantiated with the `new` keyword:

```scala
val foo = new Foo(5, "public message")
```

### Singleton Objects

A singleton object is a standalone instance that holds values and functions. They are declared with the `object` keyword:

```scala
object MySingleton {
  def func(): Unit = println("A function in a singleton!")
}
```

In the above example, the `func` can be called as `MySingleton.func()`. Methods and values from a singleton can also be imported, eg. `import MySingleton._`.

### Companion Objects

A companion object is a singleton object that is associated with a class of the same name. For example:

```scala
class Foo(value: Int) {
  private def func(): Unit = println("This Foo has value " + value)
}
object Foo {
  def makeFoo(num: Int): Foo = {
    val foo = new Foo(num)
    println("Made a Foo!")
    foo.func()
    foo
  }
}
```

Note that object Foo accesses a private member of class Foo. Classes share private values with their companion objects. Companion objects generally used to hold factory methods and global or static variables for a given class.

### Apply Methods

`apply` is the method invoked whenever parentheses are used on an object. For example:

```scala
val xs = List("a", "b", "c")
println(xs(1))
```

This prints `b`. So where is the `apply` method in the above example? Actually there are two:

1. `List("a", "b", "c")` is calling [`apply` on the List companion object](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/immutable/List$.html#apply[A](xs:A*):List[A]). This method returns a list which was then assigned to `xs`
1. `xs(1)` is calling [`apply` on the instance of class List itself](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/immutable/List.html#apply(n:Int):A), which is used to index into the List and return the n-th element (`b` in this example).
