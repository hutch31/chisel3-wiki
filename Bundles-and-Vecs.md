`Bundle` and `Vec` are classes that allow the user to expand the set of Chisel datatypes with aggregates of other types.

Bundles group together several named fields of potentially different
types into a coherent unit, much like a `struct` in C. Users
define their own bundles by defining a class as a subclass of `Bundle`
```scala
class MyFloat extends Bundle {
  val sign        = Bool()
  val exponent    = UInt(8.W)
  val significand = UInt(23.W)
}

val x  = Wire(new MyFloat)
val xs = x.sign
```

> Currently, there is no way to create a bundle literal like ```8.U``` for ```UInt```s. Therefore, in order to create literals for bundles, we must declare a [[wire|Combinational-Circuits#wires]] of that bundle type, and then assign values to it. We are working on a way to declare bundle literals without requiring the creation of a Wire node and assigning to it.

```scala
// Floating point constant.
val floatConst = Wire(new MyFloat)
floatConst.sign := true.B
floatConst.exponent := 10.U
floatConst.significand := 128.U
```

A Scala convention is to capitalize the name of new classes and we
suggest you follow that convention in Chisel too.  The ```width```
named parameter to the `UInt` constructor specifies the number
of bits in the type.

Vecs create an indexable vector of elements, and are constructed as
follows:
```scala
// Vector of 5 23-bit signed integers.
val myVec = Wire(Vec(5, SInt(23.W)))

// Connect to one element of vector. 
val reg3 = myVec(3) 
```

(Note that we specify the number followed by the type of the `Vec` elements. We also specifiy the width of the `SInt`)

The set of primitive classes
(`SInt`, `UInt`, and `Bool`) plus the aggregate
classes (`Bundles` and `Vec`s) all inherit from a common
superclass, `Data`.  Every object that ultimately inherits from
`Data` can be represented as a bit vector in a hardware design.

Bundles and Vecs can be arbitrarily nested to build complex data
structures:
```scala
class BigBundle extends Bundle {
 // Vector of 5 23-bit signed integers.
 val myVec = Vec(5, SInt(23.W))
 val flag  = Bool()
 // Previously defined bundle.
 val f     = new MyFloat
}
```

Note that the builtin Chisel primitive and aggregate classes do not
require the `new` when creating an instance, whereas new user
datatypes will.  A Scala `apply` constructor can be defined so
that a user datatype also does not require `new`, as described in
[Function Constructor](Functional-Module-Creation).

### MixedVec

(Chisel 3.2+)

All elements of a `Vec` must be of the same time. If we want to create a Vec where the elements have different types, we can use a MixedVec:

```scala
class MyModule extends Module {
  val io = IO(new Bundle {
    val x = Input(UInt(3.W))
    val y = Input(UInt(10.W))
    val vec = Output(MixedVec(UInt(3.W), UInt(10.W)))
  })
  io.vec(0) := io.x
  io.vec(1) := io.y
}
```

We can also programmatically create the types in a MixedVec:

```scala
class MyModule(x: Int, y: Int) extends Module {
  val io = IO(new Bundle {
    val vec = Input(MixedVec((x to y) map { i => UInt(i.W) }))
    // ...
  })
  // ...rest of the module goes here...
}
```

### A note on `cloneType`

Since Chisel is built on top of Scala and the JVM, it needs to know how to construct copies of bundles for various purposes (creating wires, IOs, etc). If you have a parametrized bundle and Chisel can't automatically figure out how to clone your bundle, you will need to create a custom `cloneType` method in your bundle. Most of the time, this is as simple as `override def cloneType = (new YourBundleHere(...)).asInstanceOf[this.type]`.

Note that in the vast majority of cases, **this is not required** as Chisel can figure out how to clone most bundles automatically.

Here is an example of a parametrized bundle (`ExampleBundle`) that features a custom `cloneType`.
```scala
class ExampleBundle(a: Int, b: Int) extends Bundle {
    val foo = UInt(a.W)
    val bar = UInt(b.W)
    override def cloneType = (new ExampleBundle(a, b)).asInstanceOf[this.type]
}

class ExampleBundleModule(btype: ExampleBundle) extends Module {
    val io = IO(new Bundle {
        val out = Output(UInt(32.W))
        val b = Input(chiselTypeOf(btype))
    })
    io.out := io.b.foo + io.b.bar
}

class Top extends Module {
    val io = IO(new Bundle {
        val out = Output(UInt(32.W))
        val in = Input(UInt(17.W))
    })
    val x = Wire(new ExampleBundle(31, 17))
    x := DontCare
    val m = Module(new ExampleBundleModule(x))
    m.io.b.foo := io.in
    m.io.b.bar := io.in
    io.out := m.io.out
}
```
