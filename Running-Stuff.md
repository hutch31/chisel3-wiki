### The Execution Pattern
It is a bit difficult to describe what it means to run chisel.  Chisel is not a monolithic application. It is more analogous to a collections of tools in the vein of a compiler family like gcc.  At first, when developing a new chisel circuit it is not that important what is going on under the hood.  A circuit is instantiated in the context of a test harness, usually in the form of the PeekPokeTester family and invoked via boilerplate like the following
```
   "here we assign to a F8.1 from a F8.3" in {
      chisel3.iotesters.Driver(() => new FixedPrecisionChanger(8, 3, 8, 1)) { c=>
        new FixedPointTruncatorTester(c, 6.875, 6.5)
      } should be (true)
    }
```
This article is about the chisel3.iotesters.Driver above does and how it does it, and what other members of the execution pattern do and how they do it.

### Executing chisel code written in scala.
Because Scala is based on Java and thus runs in a [JVM](https://www.google.com/search?q=jvm&oq=jvm) environment, it's a little more complicated to run than say, ```ls```.  To make this easier we use ```sbt``` which helps manage starting a JVM, managing library dependencies and running things that can be run.  *Can be run* in scala means that there is a main method defined in a companion object, though it can also be accomplished via the test harness shown above and objects that extend App.  The goal of the *Execution Pattern* is to describe a standard way of invoking various parts of the chisel toolchain particularly with respect to providing command line or internal control of those toolchain elements

### Execution Pattern Project Hierarchy 
The hierarchy currently looks like

| Level        | Project/Tool | Options |
| ---------        | --------- | ------- |
| highest | chisel-testers | See: [TesterOptions](/ucb-bar/chisel-testers/blob/master/src/main/scala/chisel3/iotesters/TesterOptions.scala) |
| - | firrtl-interpreter, firrtl-repl | See: [Interpreter Options](/ucb-bar/firrtl-interpreter/blob/master/src/main/scala/firrtl_interpreter/Driver.scala) |
| - | chisel3 | See: [ChiselExecutionOptions](/ucb-bar/chisel3/blob/master/src/main/scala/chisel3/ChiselExecutionOptions.scala) |
| lowest | firrtl | See: [CommonOptions, FirrtlOptions](/ucb-bar/firrtl/blob/master/src/main/scala/firrtl/ExecutionOptionsManager.scala) |

where higher levels depend on and, typically, call the layers below.  For example when running a test, the tester is 
invoked, which then invokes chisel3 to generate the circuit, which invokes firrtl to compile the circuit into 
low firrtl. After low firrtl has been generated, the firrtl-interpreter is invoked in order to execute 
the test on the device under test.  

Invocation here means that a execute method of a Driver companion object has been called.  Those methods can in as 
necessary or as controlled by the options can invoke the execute methods of lower level Driver objects.

### Execution Pattern Code
The execute methods of a Driver companion object (typically documented as Driver#execute) is built with a set of
scala base classes currently housed in firrtl. A driver will typically look have the following basic components

#### A Driver companion object with two execution methods
```scala
object Driver {
  def execute(optionsManager: ..., ): ExecutionResult {
    ???  
  }
  def execute(args: Array[String]: ..., ): ExecutionResult {
    ???  
  }
}
```
The args based version of the execute method is amenable to command line arguments.  The optionsManager version has additional capabilities for passing along data between toolchain components so it is used when calling a Driver#execute of a lower level.  Generally for convenience, the string based method parses the args, generates an options manager from them and the calls the options manager version.

#### An options manager
The optionManager is a container class that can hold one more configuration classes.
```scala
def execute(
      optionsManager: ExecutionOptionsManager with HasChiselExecutionOptions with HasFirrtlOptions,
      dut: () => Module): ChiselExecutionResult = {
          ???
      }
```  

#### Has*ComposableOptions*
A given declaration of a options manager extends one more traits that implement ```ComposableOptions```. In the example above from chisel3 it extends ```HasChiselExecutionOptions``` and ```HasFirrtlOptions`. Each composable options trait includes the code to add the configuration associated with it.  The ```HasChiselExecutionOptions``` is very simple and looks like
```scala
trait HasChiselExecutionOptions {
  self: ExecutionOptionsManager =>

  var chiselOptions = ChiselExecutionOptions()

  parser.note("chisel3 options")

  parser.opt[Unit]("no-run-firrtl")
    .abbr("chnrf")
    .foreach { _ =>
      chiselOptions = chiselOptions.copy(runFirrtlCompiler = false)
    }
    .text("Stop after chisel emits chirrtl file")
}
```
- The ```self: ExecutionOptionsManager =>``` says this can only extends subclasses of ExecutionOptionsManger.
- The ```var chiselOptions = ChiselExecutionOptions()``` adds a chiselOptions entry to the ExecutionOptionsManager.
- The remaining code connects command line parsing to the values stored in the ChiselOptions. The parser used is a library provided by [scopt](https://github.com/scopt/scopt) 

#### Composable Options Instances
The ChiselOptions are also quite simple and look like
```scala
case class ChiselExecutionOptions(
                                   runFirrtlCompiler: Boolean = true
                                   // var runFirrtlAsProcess: Boolean = false
                                 ) extends ComposableOptions

```
They extend ComposableOptions and are usually implemented as a [case class](http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/case-classes.html) which cannot be altered and so must be copied with new values set.  This is the reason for the construct 
``` 
    .foreach { _ =>
      chiselOptions = chiselOptions.copy(runFirrtlCompiler = false)
    }
```
in the parsing code.
> The base classes live in firrtl because, as the lowest member of the hierarchy, all higher projects depend and
> thus have access to its members

#### Execution results
And finally the execute method should return either a SuccessResult and associated data or a FailureResult and associated data.  Both Results should extend a common trait appropriate to the tool.  Chisel3's looks like
```scala
/**
  * This family provides return values from the chisel3 and possibly firrtl compile steps
  */
trait ChiselExecutionResult

/**
  *
  * @param circuitOption  Optional circuit, has information like circuit name
  * @param emitted            The emitted Chirrrl text
  * @param firrtlResultOption Optional Firrtl result, @see ucb-bar/firrtl for details
  */
case class ChiselExecutionSucccess(
                                  circuitOption: Option[Circuit],
                                  emitted: String,
                                  firrtlResultOption: Option[FirrtlExecutionResult]
                                  ) extends ChiselExecutionResult

/**
  * Getting one of these indicates failure of some sort
 *
  * @param message  a clue perhaps will be provided in the here
  */
case class ChiselExecutionFailure(message: String) extends ChiselExecutionResult
```
In Chisel3 case it uses the return result to get the circuit, any chisel firrtl (chirrtl) and possibly the result of the firrtl compilation

### What are all the options.
The complete list of options is in flux. New features and options to control them are continuously added to the toolchain.  The options available at any one time are depend on which tool is being called, and consists of that tools plus any lower level tools it might interact with.  The easiest way of getting a current list is to call A driver's execute methods passing it the command line option ```--help``` and reading the output.  Key in the following to see all the options from chisel-testers down to firrtl.
```scala
package xyz
import chisel3.iotesters.PeekPokeTester
import chisel3._

class Dummy extends Module { val io = IO(new Bundle {}) }
class DummyTester(c: Dummy) extends PeekPokeTester(c) {}
object Dummy extends App { iotesters.Driver.execute(args, () => new Dummy){ c => new DummyTester(c) }}
```
Then from the command line
```
bash> sbt 'run-main xyz.Dummy --help'
```
This will return a reasonably long list of information.  
```
